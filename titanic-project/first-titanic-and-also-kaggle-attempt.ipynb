Less than a 0.5% of missing values let us to take a different strategy as long as filling the missing values would affect nearly nothing to results. So in this case we will drop the cases where this property is not present\n\n#### Categorical values\nWe also have categorical variables that need to be encoded or dropped\n* Case 1: **'Sex'** as long as it only has 2 possibles values we can do it manually or by a label encoder.\n\n* Case 2: **'Name'** This property doesn't give useful info so drop is the best option.\n\n* Case 3: **'Ticket'** This property doesn't give useful info. Dtrop is the best option too.\n\n* Case 4: **'Cabin'** drop by missing 70% of values, also not very useful info at first sight.
